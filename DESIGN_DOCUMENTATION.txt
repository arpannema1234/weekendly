SCHEDULE FORGE - DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
=====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Schedule Forge is a modern React-based time management application that enables users to create, organize, and manage their schedules through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The application emphasizes user experience, smart conflict detection, and flexible scheduling capabilities.

MAJOR DESIGN DECISIONS AND TRADE-OFFS
=====================================

1. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
   ⤷ React Context API vs Redux
     DECISION: Used React Context API for state management
     RATIONALE: 
     - Simpler setup and maintenance for medium-scale application
     - Native React solution reduces bundle size
     - Sufficient for the app's state complexity without over-engineering
     TRADE-OFF: Less powerful dev tools compared to Redux DevTools

   ⤷ TypeScript Integration
     DECISION: Full TypeScript implementation throughout the codebase
     RATIONALE:
     - Enhanced developer experience with autocomplete and error catching
     - Better maintainability and refactoring capabilities
     - Improved code documentation through type definitions
     TRADE-OFF: Slightly increased development time for type definitions

   ⤷ Component Architecture
     DECISION: Feature-based component organization with clear separation
     STRUCTURE:
     - /components/cards/ - Activity and scheduling cards
     - /components/dnd/ - Drag and drop specific components
     - /components/layout/ - Page layout and container components
     - /components/modals/ - Modal dialogs and overlays
     - /components/tabs/ - Tab navigation components
     - /components/ui/ - Reusable UI primitives
     RATIONALE: Promotes reusability, maintainability, and clear boundaries

2. DATA PERSISTENCE STRATEGY
   DECISION: localStorage for client-side persistence
   RATIONALE:
   - No backend infrastructure required
   - Instant data access and offline functionality
   - Simple implementation for MVP scope
   TRADE-OFF: Data limited to single device, no cross-device sync

3. DRAG-AND-DROP IMPLEMENTATION
   DECISION: React DnD library with HTML5 backend
   RATIONALE:
   - Mature, well-tested library with extensive features
   - Excellent touch device support
   - Declarative API that fits React patterns
   ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED: Native HTML5 drag API (rejected for complexity)

COMPONENT DESIGN APPROACH
=========================

1. ATOMIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES
   ⤷ Applied modified atomic design methodology:
   - Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons)
   - Molecules: Composed elements (activity cards, time pickers)
   - Organisms: Complex sections (calendar view, activity browser)
   - Templates: Page layouts and tab structures

2. COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE
   ⤷ Favored composition patterns for flexibility:
   - Higher-order components for common functionality
   - Render props for complex state sharing
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic

3. PROP INTERFACE DESIGN
   ⤷ Consistent prop patterns across components:
   - Event handlers prefixed with "on" (onAdd, onRemove, onEdit)
   - Boolean props for states (isOpen, isLoading, hasConflicts)
   - Data props clearly typed with interfaces

STATE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
========================

1. CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE
   ⤷ SchedulePlannerContext as central state hub:
   - Manages current plan, saved plans, and all CRUD operations
   - Encapsulates business logic for scheduling and conflict detection
   - Provides clean API for components to interact with state

2. LOCAL STATE ORGANIZATION
   ⤷ Strategic use of useState for component-specific state:
   - Modal visibility and form data kept local
   - UI-only state (expanded panels, loading states) kept in components
   - Derived state computed on-the-fly rather than stored

3. STATE NORMALIZATION
   ⤷ Flat data structures for performance:
   - Activities stored by ID for O(1) lookups
   - Days organized as key-value pairs by date strings
   - Minimal nesting to prevent unnecessary re-renders

UI POLISH AND USER EXPERIENCE
=============================

1. VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM
   ⤷ Consistent design language throughout:
   - Color palette with semantic meaning (success, warning, danger)
   - Typography hierarchy for content organization
   - Spacing system using CSS custom properties
   - Icon library (Lucide React) for visual consistency

2. INTERACTION DESIGN
   ⤷ Intuitive user interactions:
   - Drag-and-drop with visual feedback and drop zones
   - Hover states and micro-animations for responsiveness
   - Loading states and optimistic updates for perceived performance
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

3. ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS
   ⤷ Inclusive design practices:
   - Semantic HTML elements for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Color contrast compliance
   - Focus management for modals and dynamic content

CREATIVE FEATURES AND INTEGRATIONS
==================================

1. SMART CONFLICT DETECTION SYSTEM
   ⤷ Advanced scheduling intelligence:
   - Real-time conflict detection during drag operations
   - Professional modal dialogs with detailed conflict information
   - Alternative time suggestions for conflicting activities
   - Different conflict handling for additions vs. moves

2. THEME-BASED QUICK SCHEDULING
   ⤷ Intelligent activity curation:
   - Pre-configured themes (Relaxed, Active, Social, etc.)
   - Smart time slot allocation that prevents conflicts
   - Automatic activity distribution across available days
   - Fallback scheduling when conflicts are unavoidable

3. FLEXIBLE TIME MANAGEMENT
   ⤷ Comprehensive scheduling options:
   - Variable activity durations (0.5 to 8+ hours)
   - Custom time slot selection with visual time picker
   - Dynamic day addition/removal for extended planning
   - Multi-day focused but adaptable to any date range

4. ADVANCED DRAG-AND-DROP FEATURES
   ⤷ Enhanced interaction patterns:
   - Cross-day activity movement with date updates
   - Visual feedback during drag operations
   - Conflict preview before drop completion
   - Smooth animations and transitions

5. CUSTOM ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT
   ⤷ Personalization capabilities:

1. CONFLICT RESOLUTION ALGORITHM
   ⤷ Sophisticated time overlap detection:
   - Minute-precision conflict calculation
   - Multi-activity conflict reporting
   - Intelligent gap-finding for alternative scheduling

2. STATE SYNCHRONIZATION
